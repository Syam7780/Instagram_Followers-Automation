## 📌 **Project Title:**

**Automated Instagram Interest-Based Follower Bot Using Python & Selenium**

---

## 🧠 **Abstract:**

This project is a Python-based automation tool that interacts with the Instagram web interface using the Selenium framework. It is designed to automatically log in to a user's Instagram account, search for accounts or pages based on predefined interests (e.g., technology, sports, etc.), and then auto-follow members or followers of those accounts. This helps grow the user’s network by targeting profiles with similar interests — saving time and manual effort.

---

## 🎯 **Objective:**

To build a browser automation bot that:

* Logs into Instagram using user credentials
* Searches for pages or accounts matching a keyword or interest
* Opens the follower list of a selected result
* Scrolls through the follower list and follows multiple accounts

## 🔧 **Technology Stack:**

| Component            | Tool                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Programming Language | Python 3.x                      |
| Automation Framework | Selenium WebDriver              |
| Web Parsing          | BeautifulSoup (partially)       |
| Browser Driver       | ChromeDriver                    |
| Target Platform      | Instagram Web                   |
| Optional             | Requests (for future extension) |

## 🔑 **Core Functionalities:**

### 1. **Automated Login**

* Launches Chrome browser via Selenium.
* Navigates to Instagram's login page.
* Enters email/username and password.
* Clicks the "Login" button.

> Used selectors: `input[type='text']`, `input[type='password']`, and `button[type='submit']`.

---

### 2. **Interest-Based Search**

* After login, waits for Instagram to load.
* Opens the **Search** functionality.
* Inputs a keyword (e.g., `"technology"`) into the search field.
* Clicks on the first matching result (page or account).

> Purpose: To access pages aligned with the user’s interests.

---

### 3. **Auto-Follow Feature**

* Clicks on the "Followers" button of the selected account.
* Scrolls through the followers list (automated scrolling to load more).
* Detects users not followed yet.
* Clicks the **"Follow"** button for each.

> The loop is limited (e.g., first 10 scroll loads) to avoid detection or rate-limiting by Instagram.

## 🗃️ **File Breakdown:**

| File               | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.py`          | Core bot logic including login, search, follow    |
| `chromedriver.exe` | WebDriver executable to control Chrome            |
| `requirements.txt` | Python packages needed (Selenium, requests, etc.) |

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Safety**

* Includes appropriate `time.sleep()` delays to avoid triggering Instagram's bot detection.
* Carefully designed DOM selectors to match dynamic elements.
* Only interacts with visible buttons and elements (ethical automation).

> Note: Instagram has aggressive bot-detection systems. Use this tool responsibly and for educational purposes.

---

## 📌 **Limitations:**

* May break if Instagram updates its HTML structure (DOM changes).
* ChromeDriver version must match the installed Chrome version.
* Hardcoded credentials (in the sample) should be secured using `.env` or config files.
* The bot doesn't handle captcha or 2FA (two-factor authentication).

## 📚 **Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of browser automation using Selenium,
  web interaction through dynamic selectors, and practical use of Python for real-world
  applications. It automates tedious tasks like login, search, and following users on
    Instagram based on interests — showcasing how AI/ML students can blend automation
    with social media intelligence.
